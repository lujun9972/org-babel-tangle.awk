* What is it?
This is a re-implementation of the Org-Mode function org-babel-tangle, in Awk.

I write it because someday I saw the [[https://github.com/thblt/org-babel-tangle.py][org-babel-tangle.py]] project, and then I thought it would be fun to write an awk version one.

* Usage
Usage is very simple, put this program somewhere in $PATH, then:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  org-babel-tangle.awk dotfile.org
#+END_SRC

* Limits
Just like the [[https://github.com/thblt/org-babel-tangle.py][org-babel-tangle.py]]. All it does is routing lines of text to output files and fixing indentation, and even don't support the TRAMP style path.

Sine I am pretty new at =awk=, any pull request is welcome, Thanks.
